<p>Today was the first time I saw a page 404 not found on facebok. This really made me think of why this still exists..</p>

<p>Why the client side is not intelligent enough to redirect the wrong/missing path to the main page? Ok you want to show a message in the case this happen the user can go to FAQ and see how he can proceed(are you sure the user will see the FAQ or he will just leave?). Ok so let's use a modal!</p>

<blockquote>This is sparta!</blockquote>

<p>Thinking in some how help to solve this
